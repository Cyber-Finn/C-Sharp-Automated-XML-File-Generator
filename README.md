# Automated XML-File Generator
This is a Software Testing tool that takes input XSD Documents and automatically generates Test XML files that match the XSD specification.
<br>
This is perfect for creating the general XML structure of the file, according to the XSD, with some basic Fuzz data that matches the rules of the XSD specification.

## Notes:
<li>I have included some very basic XSD documents within the "Sample XSD Files" folder.</li>
<li>Feel free to add support for different XML element types as needed. I have only catered for the common ones</li>

## Requirements:
This application works as-is, but does require Microsoft's .Net Version 8 to run. 
<br>
You can find the download for .Net 8 [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).
